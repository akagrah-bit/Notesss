Navigating the file system 

pwd — Displays your current directory. 

ls — Lists files and directories. 

ls -l (detailed view) 

ls -a (shows hidden files) 

cd — Changes the current directory. 

 

Examples: 

cd /path/to/directory (absolute path) 

cd Documents (relative path) 

cd .. (move up one directory) 

cd ~ (go to home directory) 

Tips: 

touch filename.txt — Creates an empty file. 

mkdir myfolder — Creates a new directory. 

Read: 

cat filename.txt — Displays the contents of a file. 

less filename.txt — Allows you to scroll through a file. 

 

Update: 

nano filename.txt — Opens a file in the Nano text editor. 

echo "Text" &gt;&gt; filename.txt — Appends text to a file. 

Delete: 

rm filename.txt — Removes a file. 

rmdir myfolder — Removes an empty directory. 

rm -r myfolder — Removes a directory and its contents recursively. 

3. File Permissions and chmod 

Understanding Permissions: 

Use ls -l to view file permissions. 

Permissions are shown as -rwxrwxrwx, divided into User (u), Group (g), and Others (o). 

r — Read (4) 

w — Write (2) 

x — Execute (1) 

Changing Permissions: 

Symbolic method: 

chmod u+x filename — Adds execute permission for the user. 

chmod g-w filename — Removes write permission from the group. 

Numeric method: 

chmod 755 filename — Sets permissions to rwxr-xr-x. 

Online resources like "Understanding chmod in Linux" can be very helpful. 

 

4. Using sudo for Superuser Privileges 

Basics: 

sudo [command] — Runs a command with superuser privileges. 

Example: sudo apt update — Updates package lists.
